## Description
this plugin add validation checkbox for "Term of Service" or "Terms & Condition" to your Question2Answer site's Registration page.

## Installation
1. Download the plugins and extract "q2a-terms-of-service" directory.
2. Upload it to your Q2A's plugin directory (`qa-plugins/q2a-terms-of-service`).
3. In Q2A go to **Admin > plugins > Terms of Service** and choose options, then save the form.

### Q2A Versions
Q2A 1.7 comes with a built-in option to enable this feature inside Q2A itself. so this project will no longer be continued. however it's still only plugin with this feature for Q2A 1.6 and older versions of question2answer.

### Important installation note
This plugin can use Client Side(JavaScript) and Server Side(PHP) Validation.
if you enable  **Check validation in server side instead of using JavaScript** option in plugin's settings, it overrides whole registration page to use Server Side Validation! it means that if you are using a version of Q2A other than 1.6.x, you might face some problems with it. so I suggest that you *disable this option*.
